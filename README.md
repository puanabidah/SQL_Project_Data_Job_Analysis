# üõ†Ô∏è Tools I used

For my deep dive into the analysis, I used several tools to support that:

- SQL: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and the data.
- PostgreSQL: my primary database system for managing relational data, leveraging SQL for querying and manipulating data.
- Visual Studio Code: my go-to code editor, which I used with SQL and PostgreSQL extensions.
- Git & GitHub: Git is essential for version control while GitHub used for sharing all of my codes along with some documentation.

# The Analysis

Each query of this project aimed to investigate some specific aspect of the Data Analyst job market. Here's how I approached that:

## 1. Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs

This query highlights the top 10 highest-paying Data Analyst jobs that are available remotely and focuses on specified salaries.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    name AS company_name,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM job_postings_fact as jp
LEFT JOIN company_dim as cd
    ON jp.company_id = cd.company_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
      job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
      salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Here's the breakdown from the list of top 10 highest-paying remote data analyst roles in 2023:

- **Exceptional Earning Potential at the Very Top**: The highest-paying role, "Data Analyst" at Mantys with a staggering $650,000 annual salary, indicates that highly specialized or senior-level remote data analyst positions can command exceptionally high compensation, potentially far exceeding typical data analyst salary ranges.
- **Leadership and Specialized Roles Drive High Salaries**: Many of the top roles are leadership positions (Director, Associate Director, Principal Data Analyst), suggesting that experience and the ability to lead data-driven strategies are highly valued. Additionally, specialization in areas like marketing (Pinterest) and AV performance (Motional) can also lead to premium pay.
- **Remote Work is Viable at All Levels**: The presence of fully remote roles across various seniority levels (from "Data Analyst" at Mantys to "Principal Data Analyst" at multiple companies) demonstrates that high-paying data analyst positions are increasingly available with the flexibility of remote work arrangements. Even hybrid roles on this list still offer a significant degree of remote work.

## 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs

To understand what skills are required for top-paying jobs, I combined the job posting data with skills data, provides information on the companies and the specific skills they need, correlated with the highest average salaries.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS(
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        name AS company_name,
        salary_year_avg
    FROM job_postings_fact AS jp
    LEFT JOIN company_dim AS cd
        ON jp.company_id = cd.company_id
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    tpj.*,
    skills AS skills_required
FROM top_paying_jobs AS tpj
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS sj
    ON tpj.job_id = sj.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim AS sd
    ON sj.skill_id = sd.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC;
```

Here's the breakdown of skills for the top 10 high-paying Data Analyst jobs in 2023:

- SQL got the most mentions (8 times).
- Python and Tableau followed closely, with 7 and 6 mentions respectively.
- Othe skills like R, Snowflake, Pandas, and Excel show varying degree of demand.
- This indicates that SQL and Python are the most sought-after skills in high-paying data analyst roles, while Tableau is also a strong contender.

## 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analyst Role

This query focuses on the top 5 most in-demand skills for Data Analyst positions that are remote (work from home), regardless of salary.

```sql

INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS sj
    ON j.job_id = sj.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim AS s
    ON sj.skill_id = s.skill_id
WHERE j.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
      AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Here's the breakdown of the most in-demand skills for Data Analyst jobs in 2023:
